# colourEncoder
A macro for encoding shape information in Intensity Values

The user should open the macro, and hit the "Run" button, then point the dialog at a file containing a 0-value background and solidly-coloured objects. From a long list of options, the user can choose:
- Which measurement to encode in the intensity of the image (e.g. Area, Circularity, Solidity)
- Whether this information is to be rank-coded or reflect the absolute values
- Whether the colour-coding should be scaled to fill the 255 values of the 8-bit image, or not
